For using the FordiacProjectLoader you have to perform two steps:

1) Instantiate the Loader itself: FordiacProjectLoader loader = new FordiacProjectLoader(projectFilename);
   Whereas the projectFilename is the project name represented as String
   
2) You need to load your 4diac workspace where your project is located. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27088926/run-eclipse-plug-in-test-with-included-workspace-projects

3) Done. You now have access to AutomationSystem: loader.getAutomationSystem();
