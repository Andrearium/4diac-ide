<p id="topOfPage">To understand what's next, you need to know IEC 61499. 
If you did not read the following page yet, go there now: <a href="../../html/before4DIAC/iec61499.html">Learn about IEC 61499</a></p>

<h1 id="iec61499Framework">4diac Framework</h1>

<p>This section outlines the big picture from the design to actually controlling physical units.</p>

<p>As shown in the IEC 61499 explanation, an application developed using this standard uses Function Blocks (FB). 
There are ways of creating and defining FBs, but at some point in the workflow ranging from FBs to actually controlling something physical, the logic behind the FBs and the FB networks has to be implemented. 
That's where the runtime environment comes in. 
This software loads the network of FBs and then executes the events and follows the rules of the standard like the one seen <a href="../../html/before4DIAC/iec61499.html#FBInternalSequence" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p>So, where is the runtime environment in the standard? Nowhere. 
Basically, IEC 61499 defines how to develop a distributed industrial system, but not how to implement it. 
In the next image, the idea behind decoupling the application development and the execution is presented.</p>

<img class="center" src="../../html/before4DIAC/img/iec61499Framework.png" alt="IEC 61499 framework" />

<p>The rectangle on the top represents the system according to IEC 61499. 
Here, you need a tool that allows creating FBs and connecting them. 
Also, it should represent the devices of your system, and some method to show the part of your application which will be deployed to each device. 
This is usually done on a normal computer.</p>

<p>The big squares in the second row represent real devices such as PLCs, some control hardware, or a Raspberry Pi. 
In these devices, the mentioned runtime environment should run. 
It receives information from the top rectangle to create the network of FBs, execute FBs, send events between FBs, and so on. 
The devices normally have inputs and outputs which are accessed by the runtime environment.</p>

<h1 id="4diacFramework">Eclipse 4diac</h1>

<p>Eclipse 4diac provides two projects and allows developing distributed control systems compliant to the IEC 61499 standard:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="inlineTitle">4diac FORTE:</span> 
	The runtime environment is a small portable C++ implementation of an IEC 61499 runtime environment which supports the execution of distributed control programs on small embedded devices. 
	4diac FORTE runs above a device's OS. 
	It is a multi-threaded and less memory-consuming runtime environment and has been tested on the following systems:
	<ul>
		<li>Windows Cygwin on i386, ppc and xScale</li>
		<li>Linux on i386, ppc and xScale</li>
		<li>NetOS </li>
		<li>RTOS on IPC@chip </li>
		<li>eCos ARM7 </li>
		<li>rcX from Hilscher</li>
		<li>vxworks</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span class="inlineTitle">4diac IDE:</span> This is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that represents the top rectangle above. 
	It's written in Java, based on the Eclipse framework and provides an extensible engineering environment for modeling distributed control applications compliant to the IEC 61499 standard. 
	   You use 4diac IDE to create FBs, applications, configure the devices and other tasks related to IEC 61499.
	   Within 4diac IDE, these results are also downloaded to devices running 4diac FORTE.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because the development of systems according to IEC 61499 and the runtime environment are decoupled, some things have to be taken into account. 
As described, you can create FBs in the IDE. 
At this point, however, the runtime environment doesn't know that the FB exists nor how to execute it. 
Within 4diac IDE, you therefore have the possibility to export your created FB into 4diac FORTE code (i.e., C++ files). 
You then need to add your exported code to the source code of 4diac FORTE and compile all as explained <a href="../installation/install.html">here</a>.

This is possible only for Basic and Composite Function Blocks (BFB and CFB), since both definitions are in the standard.
However, Service Function Blocks (SFBs) are coded from scratch, since these FBs are not defined in the standard.</p>

<p>4diac IDE is extensible, meaning that it can be easily extended to support exporting to another runtime environment.</p>

<h2>Human Machine Interface</h2>

<p>4diac FORTE is intended to run in PLCs, so a Graphical User Interface (GUI) as Human Machine Interface (HMI) is not supported. 
We therefore recommend to use the Function Block Development Kit (FBDK) by Dr. James H. Christensen for HMI. 
FBDK is a Java-based IEC 61499 framework and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.holobloc.com/" target="_blank">Holobloc Inc</a>. 
Its runtime environment FBRT can be started within the 4diac IDE as well, whereas 4diac IDE contains the HMI Function Blocks of FBDK within its library.</p>

<p>In other words, FBDK is another tool similar to 4diac IDE, and FBRT is a runtime environment similar to 4diac FORTE.
Unlike 4diac FORTE, it's written in Java and supports developing a GUI. 
Since all these tools are developed according to same <a href="../../html/before4DIAC/iec61499.html#iec61499ComplianceProfiles" target="_blank">Compliance Profile</a>, there aren't any problems in using them together. 
In 4diac IDE you find the Function Blocks for the GUI that can be used by FBDK, but not in 4diac FORTE.</p>
